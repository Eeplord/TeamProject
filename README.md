# TeamProject

On Unix, after pulling the files to your local machine type 
"make" in the terminal to compile the project. Then type
"./run" to execute the program.

On Visual Studio, you can probably just copy the files into
a project and run it that way, but I have not tested this.

It seems pretty simple, and it would be great if we followed
it. If you see any violations of these guidelines in our
code, please make the appropriate changes.
